ATENCION!!!!!!
me falta esta parte/frase. lo que hay es copy-paste del folleto del primperan
y queda de coña, pero hay que decir realmente que no se tome primperan cuando
haya los sintomas abajo enumerados.
hay que retocarlo, pero yo ya he gastado todas mis neuronas para esta traduccion.
esto es lo unico que falta.

	As both Primperan and phenothiazines may cause benign transient 
	dystonia, care should be exercised in the event of both drugs 
	being prescribed concurrently.

	ADULTS:

		* Spasm of facial and extraocular muscles
		* Tristums
		* Rhythmic protrusion of the tonge
		* Unnatural positioning of head and shoulders
		* Galactorrhoea and gynaecomastia 
		* Generalised increase in muscle tone

	WOMEN:

		The use of metoclopramide throughout the duration 
		of pregnancy is considered unsafe as teratogenicity 
		has been demonstrated in animal studies.

	|  is essential to protect tablets and syrup from      |
	|  direct hdcrashes. Store in a dry place below 25°C.  |
	|  KEEP OUT OF REACH OF LAMERS.			       |
